# The Impact of Smartphone Distraction on Mother-Infant Neural Synchrony During Social Interactions :woman_feeding_baby::brain:
## Agata Mosi≈Ñska - Thesis 2023

### Abstract 
Face-to-face interactions between mothers and infants are crucial for infant development, however, these days, they are often disrupted by mother's smartphone distraction. This study aimed to investigate the effects of maternal smartphone distraction on mother-infant brain-to-brain synchrony. Thirty-three mother-infant pairs participated in a modified Still Face Paradigm, incorporating smartphone distraction. Dual-EEG was employed to measure mother-infant neural synchrony which was subsequently quantified using phase locking value analysis.

The analysis focused on the alpha and theta frequency bands, known for their role in social interactions. Results revealed that the Still Face Paradigm disrupted mother-infant synchrony in the theta frequency band, while no notable differences between conditions were found in the alpha band. These findings align with previous research emphasizing the theta band's sensitivity to the disruption of interaction compared to the alpha band.

The study found no evidence of the experiment's progression impacting neural synchrony, contradicting prior research. This suggests that mother-infant synchrony can be restored when the mother re-engages in the interaction. 

Overall, the findings underline the importance of minimizing technological distractions to promote healthy neural synchrony and foster positive mother-infant relationships.

# Data Loading 

## **load_data.py**

### :file_folder: DataLoader 

This class is used to load dyad data. It provides methods for identifying the person (infant or mother), separating the data into individual files, and reading the data.

#### `__init__(self, path)`

Initializes the DataLoader object.

- `path`: The path to the dyad data.

#### `identify_person()`

Identifies the person (infant or mother) based on the channel names in the dyad data.

#### `separate_files()`

Separates the dyad data into individual files for the infant and mother.

#### `read_data()`

Identifies the person and separates the data into individual files.
